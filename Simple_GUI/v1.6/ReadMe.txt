
The 'gogrepo.exe' file, is a compiled version of 'gogrepo.py', and was compiled by Timboli (from the GOG Forums), using the last original version of 'gogrepo.py' as source.

It was compiled on a Windows 7, 32 Bit PC, where Python 3.4 and required libraries were installed, for use with 'gogrepo.py' and 'GOGRepo Simple GUI' and related.

The last original version of 'gogrepo.py', a Python program (script) can be found at GitHub.
