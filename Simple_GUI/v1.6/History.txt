
(v1.6) GOGRepo Simple GUI has now been adapted for use with a special compiled version of gogrepo.exe.

(v1.5) FSUM is no longer required or used. Window controls now get disabled during processes.

(v1.4) BUGFIX for incorrect line ending insertions into gogrepo.py. These insertions did not occur if using the Kalanyr forked version of gogrepo.py.

(v1.3) Added a file Size field. Two buttons resized with multiline text. Some text changes.

(v1.2) BUGFIX for detecting the version of 'gogrepo.py'. This involves checking for the Kalanyr forked version, which is automatically supported, and then checking for a modified version of the original 'gogrepo.py', which is also supported. The user is queried if neither are the case, with an option to modify the existing. 7-Zip is now checked for at startup, with priority given to the '7z.exe' file over '7za.exe' if found.
