# GOGRepo-GUI
A frontend GUI for the gogrepo.py Python script that interacts with GOG.com.

The gogrepo.py script obtains a manifest of a user's game file library at GOG.com, and enables updating that manifest locally and downloading the game files (including related extras), and verifying those downloads, etc.

The gogrepo.py script can be found here - https://github.com/eddie3/gogrepo

GOGRepo GUI makes things easier to do, especially for those not comfortable with the command-line or using BAT files, plus it has some additional features.

BIG THANKS to woolymethodman, Kalanyr, etc for gogrepo. And thanks to Flyingfluffypiglet for extra inspiration.
